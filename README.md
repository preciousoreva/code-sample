*** File name Binary search php ***

This function takes in a sorted array and a value to search for as parameters. 
It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the array in half until it finds the value or determines that it is not in the array. 
The function returns the index of the value in the array if it is found, or -1 if it is not found.
