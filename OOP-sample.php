<!-- OOP Code sample  -->

<!-- This example creates a Car class with properties for make, model, year, and color, 
and methods for getting and setting each property. 
It also has a method called displayCar that shows all the car's properties.
A new instance of the car class is created using the constructor and then the method displayCar is called on it to display all the properties. -->
